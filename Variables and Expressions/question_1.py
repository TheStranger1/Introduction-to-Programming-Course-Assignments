#Consider the following program:
#a = 3, b = 6 and c = 7
#Complete the program by adding two new variables: sum and average; calculate the sum of a,
#b and c to sum and the average of a, b and c to average. Finally, output the values of the
#variables sum and average.


a = 3
b = 6
c = 7
# The next line represents the sum of a,b and c
sum = a+b+c

#The next line represents the avarage of a,b and c
average = sum/3.0

print sum
print average
